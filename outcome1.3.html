The first thing to do is making a mind map of all the website idea, theme, what it must include, colours and what programmes will best my design etc. do this for a few ideas you have and put it together on a flow diagram of the final draft– this will include step by step of each page etc. another part of designing a website is using Kanban method i.e. Trello - putting all the information and making lists of things you need to do. This can also include description for each part that needs doing. Also, for group projects you assigned a person for each task on the list and moved it to review, completed [10].</p>
