    <h2 class="center">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>

    <p> There are ways to making a project reach its full potential to succeed, if it is a group project or independent project. Before diving in deep at programming and codes needed, you need to do project management and planning. For my group project I used stand-up and Kanban method. Stand up is a short meeting between the team that is done quickly, at least 2 – 3 a day or after reaching or complete of tasks, that we did on Zoom video calls. The aim is to go over the important tasks that need to be finished, are in progress or to be started [4].</p>

    <p>The Kanban method is managing the formation of a project with an emphasis on constant delivery whiles not overburdening the team. Kanban method helps the team work effectively together. With my group project we used Trello. Trello helps you organise and plan your project, by making separate lists of what needs doing and in progress and what is complete [5].</p>

    <p>To create a well-designed project, it is essential to have required skills such as problem solving – to know the basics of coding and being able to implement it in your work [6]. Problem solving is not about writing out different code until you get the code working. It about planning what the code requires and how you are going to through with it [7]. 
    Teamwork whiles designing and conducting a project increases efficiency, distribute workload, improves communication and establishing culture and making team feel a sense of belonging and empowerment [8]. </p>

    <p>When planning for your project things you would think about is the recourse you have available and what you can have access to. Basic requirements would be is having a well-functioning computer or laptop with ability to download programmes needed. Also, another aspect would what the budget for the project is – this mean you can pay for programmes that makes coding easier [9].</p>
