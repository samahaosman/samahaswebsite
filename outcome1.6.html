    <h2 class="center">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code’s version control</h2>
    <p>Using trello for my project was very beneficial and it has many features worth exploring. Trello helped reduce confusion by simple tools to organise task and track progress. I could use the trello lists, customise and assign tasks to the team to work according to until due. it allowed to collaborate in important discussions, send notes, share files and comment on individual tasks. You can set your trello account on public, invites others and upload the files onto Dropbox or Google drive [14].</p>

    <p>GitHub allows you to track of collaborative and personal projects. All files are held together and other can add in their codes and graph etc. to develop the project. GitHub store the files history making easier to access at point of the code being updated. You have access to other codes, you can add comments, suggest changes in between lines and the overall document. GitHub has a similar feature to trello – you can assign tasks, making it clear who is responsible for whatever part of the tasks. version control helps with personal projects by allowing to keep track of your work and easily direct between other versions of the files you create and maintaining an online backup [15].</p>
