    <h2 class="center">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>

    <p>General data protection regulation (GDPR) in digital project allows users of online services to have a considerable amount of control in the way their data is processed. This gives the user more insight on how much data is kept on them, how it is used and allowing them the option to restrict or opt out of the processing of their data [16].</p>

    <p>The GDPR strengthened their data protection rights by implementing their new Digital privacy legislation, which was introduced on 25th May 2019.  This requires companies to build in privacy settings into their digital websites and ensure they are switched on by default. Companies are also required to conduct regular Privacy risk assessments to improve the collection of private data, as well as identifying and communicating data breaches [17]. </p>
