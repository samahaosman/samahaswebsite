    <h2 class="center"> 1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p>Having an IT team that is well trained is very important to keeping the business stable, no matter how big or small and across all industries. Communication at workplace is vital and some form of communication may be via phone or email. If one of these systems broke or went offline not only would collaborating with colleagues become a pain, your clients will also feel the impact as well. Therefore, an IT team would be required to do the troubleshooting – they are trained to know the ins and outs of the computer systems [1].</p>

    <p>As a business owner you need to be organised and know when your stock is low. Having an IT team will help by making sure that additional stock is automatically ordered when needed. Making sure connect your inventory management system with your POS system and to keep this closed- loop running.</p>

    <p>Many years ago, companies would have rows and rows of filing cabinets with all the documents. But now we store data in the cloud and in some other digital server. It is the IT team’s job to make sure your data is well maintained and secure [2].
    </p>

    <p>An IT team’s responsibilities are organising data so that it could be used to track sales, manage expenses, monitor activities and customer relationships. They can help boost productivity, perform client outreach, capitalise on opportunities, making special offers and react to any abnormal activity on the account [3].</p>
