    <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
    <p>I studied 3 years of biomedical science and started working as a Medical Laboratory Assistant. Whiles working I wanted to try something new because I felt like my job was too repetitive and once I learnt everything it seemed like the same thing every day. One day I stumbled up on a code nation. Before jumping in the deep end, I thought myself let me give it a go. I tried to learn coding on my own, but it felt like I was opening doors and each door there was a load of information that I could not understand. I decided to not give up on it and I attending an open day and taster day.</p>

    <p>It was great I learnt a lot, but I was still lost with all the information and that is when I realised, I can never fully know everything about coding. That made me happy because there will always be a problem to solve and something new to learn.</p>

    <p>This is my final week of the three-week course at code nation; I have learnt a lot about coding I did not know. I also got feel of how it would be working as a junior developer. Not only did I build of my coding skills, now I understand the importance of working as team to complete a project. I have built on my confidence, breaking out of my shelf, speaking up when I need to. I have realised that coding is just 50% of the work of junior developer. There is a lot of planning, project management and presenting involved.</p>

    <p>So far, I am enjoying my experience, being with 20 random students I have never met before and working as though we have been in the same office for 10 years. It is amazing. I love the energy and atmosphere the teacher brings into it.</p>

    <p>I have a secret passion for baking for a while now and I have started mini business out of it. For the past year I have using social media to promote my work. I have been wanted to create a website to showcase my work and start taking orders from it. Now that I have reached the end of the course, I feel like I have the basic tool and knowledge to create my website.</p>
