    <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in </h3>
    <p>Creating my website would have been easier working as team because we could have divided the task, questions and finished earlier to do the finishing touch by using other programme such as flex etc. we could have utilised slack and zoom more by sharing our codes as snippets on slack and updating each other whenever we need to. Make group calls on zoom for discussing the development of the website and screen share to help navigate and teach each other. We could used trello to our advantage as we could have made a share board and used the Kanban method to assign each of task and we could check when they completed and help them when we have finished our tasks. Trello would have been useful if working as team because would divided the tasks fairly.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
    <p>A way of improving my productivity and efficiency is to keep updating trello because when I return to complete my website, I know what stage I am at. Another way would be using my personal time to do all or some of questions so that during class time I work on improving and using new feature for my website to make look nicer. Or making sure I finish task assigned for that day before the end of the day- this way I can start on the new task and not have a lot of work pilling up. Also, proof reading and testing my website after every time I update it – doing this will reduce error and less time debugging codes.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  </h3>
    <p>Creating a website for the first was quite difficult as I was learning to make a website and making a website at the same time. Next time, I would know what I need to do therefore, it would take me as long as. I think it was better that I created my first website on my own so that when I do develop a website as a team, I can have more input and take on more tasks. In my future group website development project, I would have gained more knowledge on HTML and CSS features, I will be able to join my understand and my team to create an even better website. I would utilise slack more as I would need to communicate with my team member. Creating my current website slack was not an important factor because I used it mainly to get information for my teacher or to join zoom calls. </p>

    <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
    <p>A way of testing digital solution is using a testing service such as Sogeti, they do mobile testing, web testing, app testing and API testing. They cover compatibility testing, functional testing, test automation, accessibility, security testing etc.</p>

    <p>Another way is doing it yourself by making checklist of all the things that can go wrong and testing to make sure that it does not happen i.e. making sure the website opens in all browsers, making sure it looks the same as it would on a PC and on phone, making sure the website preforms as needed etc.</p>
