    <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h3>

    <h4 class="center">Visual Studio code</h4>
    <p>As this is my first-time coding using visual studios code to learn I found that it was very easy to understand and navigate around the programme. I was happy using visual studios code and I would use it again when working on personal projects. I used python on visual studio as the teacher recommended that it is best programme for beginners, I agree because I picked up on everything quickly. Eventually when the core structure of my website was ready, we implemented HTML and CSS. HTML allowed me to the information on a website and CSS allowed to develop to website and make it look nicer. Both programmes we very useful and easy to learn.  </p>

    <h4 class="center">Trello</h4>
    <p>I enjoyed using trello, it helped me keep organised and whenever I felt like a have too much to do and did not know where to start. I would use trello make lists, checklists and set priorities. At first, I was sceptical because it thought it would take too much time updating it. But I found it useful as was working on my website I would always refer to trello when before and after my breaks and in the morning and before the end of the day. This allowed me to know what I need to and what is left by doing this never felt overwhelmed or confused. </p>

    <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h3>

    <h4 class="center"> Visual Studios code</h4>
    <p>I was assigned to build my website on visual studio, I found that it was the best choice because it is a fast code editor and its perfect for day to day use. It supports hundreds of languages and it helps you be productive with syntax highlighting, box-selecting, auto- indentation and snippets. It has easy customisation, supports key board shortcuts allowing you to navigate your code with ease and many more features [20].</p>

    <h4 class="center">Trello</h4>
    <p>My teacher asked me to update every stage of my website development on trello as he can keep track and check how I was doing. Trello was the perfect to tool to do that because I didn’t need to keep sending zip files and snippet to overload slack. Trello is an organised and understandable when done correctly. Using the Kanban method and producing list of what I need to do, doing and completed, using used trello to my advantage by adding a review lists so when my teacher reviews I know I can move it into the completed list. I also added checklists within the lists to break down my tasks even further.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?  </h3>

    <h4 class="center">Strengths</h4>
    <p>Some strengths of my website would be that it has different images in each background and keeps me thinking what I would see next, it starts with a logo and leads you to all my work. I feel like the pages portray all my hard work and how I have improved from when I started baking. I also like the features I used such as linking my pages together with a nav bar, how the background does not move as you scroll down the page and that put different sized headings and sub headings. </p>

    <h4 class="center">weaknesses</h4>
    <p>some weakness of my website is that my background images make it harder to read the writing and it is distracting. Also, there is one page that does not open when I press the link on the nav bar, there are too much writing on some pages and they are widely spread out.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  </h3>
    <p>To improve my website, I would change my writing to white to make easier to read or make my image more transparent. I would use flex feature to navigate my back ground to fit the page better and create a nicer looking nav bar – I would make the nav bar fit equally on each line and put each unit on a separate like and separately boxed with colours inside the box.  I would make sure the nav bar work properly and linked. If has more time I would create more pages for some of the questions in unit 1 outcome 2 and 3 and unit 2 outcome 1.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
    <p>I have prepared the appropriate content for my website by answer all the questions to the best of my ability, making sure I answer each question correctly and providing references where needed.  After answering the question on a word document, used html on visual studios to project all the information on a website. I used heading and sub-headings and made paragraphs, I tried to make it clear and make it look nice by putting the sub heading in the centre. I also used a nav bar and linked all my pages together. I changed the format of my background images jpg. So that it opens on my website. Lastly, I tested my website by making everything work from page to page.</p>
